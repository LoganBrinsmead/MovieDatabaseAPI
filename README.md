This is an API I created for a movie review database.

This API runs on Koa, a minimal web application framework from the creators of Express. This API also uses passportJS for user authentication and bcryptjs for password hashing and salting, and Redis for session storing.

This API works in tandem with a MySQL movie review website database that I also designed and developed.
